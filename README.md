## Thesis II: John Kenney
### Description:
  For my thesis I am developing my own game engine and using that game engine developing my own video game.

## Overview
The purpose of this thesis is to gain as much exposure to the game dev realm as I can. When I had decided on doing a game I then had to narrow my decision as to how I would go about doing this. I also have a great passion for designing data manipulation, designing large programs etc. The options as to what I could use to build this game were many however, I chose to use the Love 2D game engine. Love 2D is an open source 2D game engine that uses LUA - programming language to provide basic functionality at its most basic implementation. 
### Why ? 
I have goals and aspirations that surround the game dev space, although I could have chosen a more flashy game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine 5 what I would have gained in complexity I would have lost in full control of the design. I thought being in the current situation I am that it would be adventagious to simulate as much of the proccess as possible, that means from the begininng designs, game engine design + implementation, to the actual development of the game would help me achieve this. 
### My own game engine...
Love 2D as mentioned is a basic game engine that is open source and allows the user(s) to vastly build upon the basics Love 2D already provides. I want to take a more Object Oriented Apporach here as I build out large blueprints for my games main objects. This will include a player class, enemy class, button class, and even a large container like class that will allow for level development to be rapid so that the user can focus more on the scaling of their game rather than the tedious redundant coding they would spend doing otherwise. This is essential to the process to game dev as many games use their own engine to make a game and each engine has their pros and cons and this is a great test to see what I truly enjoy in the process, some things I want to learn more about, some things I am not so interested in. These are the answers I am looking for throughout the development of this project.

### Love 2OOD - Love 2D with Objected Oriented Programming
My game engine will be called Love 2OOD - pronounced Love "Tude-e", this is more of an extension of the already existing love 2d framework, but reformatting and redesigning the implementation and structure as well as abstracting a lot away. Once complete I will then implement my own engine to create a somewhat large scale game.

### Forge On...
The name of my game is forge on, in a far away land...Echo Rift, the evil Dr. Killian Yenyth reins supreme leading the Yenyth Empire comprised of Gharthas and other monsters. Our hero Helion washes up on the shores of Echo Rift, greated by a mysterious yet friendly creature Rick ! From here Rick goes on to explain that Dr. Yenyth has had his rule over Echo Rift for far too long and reqeusts the help of Helion to liberate Echo Rift. Will you help...?
